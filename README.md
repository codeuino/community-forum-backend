# Spansberry-Backend
Spansberry project aims to provide a discussion platform to all community members which can easily organize various topics for discussions under different categories and start/continue discussion on any topic. This organisation of the topics will help the community keep track of all the discussions under various domains, thus providing ease of communications. 
Spansberry also aims to have a smart discussion feature using which user can set and organise meetings, reminders, tasks etc. and see all of these from different discussions at one place, i.e. Workspace which will be a dashboard for all of these features. Hence from one place user will see the progress, tasks, meets, schedules, mentions from different discussions.
